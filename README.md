**Memory Game** is a Light & Sound Memory game to apply for CodePath's SITE Program. 

Submitted by: **Kamil Piziak**

Time spent: **2** hours spent in total

Link to project: (https://glitch.com/edit/#!/clumsy-understood-titanosaurus)

## Required Functionality

The following **required** functionality is complete:

* [x] Game interface has a heading (h1 tag), a line of body text (p tag), and four buttons that match the demo app
* [x] "Start" button toggles between "Start" and "Stop" when clicked. 
* [x] Game buttons each light up and play a sound when clicked. 
* [x] Computer plays back sequence of clues including sound and visual cue for each button
* [x] Play progresses to the next turn (the user gets the next step in the pattern) after a correct guess. 
* [x] User wins the game after guessing a complete pattern
* [x] User loses the game after an incorrect guess

The following **optional** features are implemented:

* [x] Any HTML page elements (including game buttons) has been styled differently than in the tutorial
* [x] Buttons use a pitch (frequency) other than the ones in the tutorial
* [x] More than 4 functional game buttons
* [x] Playback speeds up on each turn
* [x] Computer picks a different pattern each time the game is played
* [x] Player only loses after 3 mistakes (instead of on the first mistake)
* [x] Game button appearance change goes beyond color (e.g. add an image)
* [ ] Game button sound is more complex than a single tone (e.g. an audio file, a chord, a sequence of multiple tones)
* [ ] User has a limited amount of time to enter their guess on each turn

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [ ] List anything else that you can get done to improve the app!

## Reflection Questions
1. If you used any outside resources to help complete your submission (websites, books, people, etc) list them here. 
I did not utilize any outside resources to help complete the submission.

2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words) 
    During this submission, many challenges arose throughout. For example,
   one challenge that arose was keeping track of the Javascript functions that had to be created. As I am not that
   familiar with Javascript, I had to look numerous times back and forth each file to make the connection between the function defined in
   Javascript, and how it would affect the website as a whole. After some time, however, I managed to finally figure out how to solve this
   by visually drawing out the function on a separate piece of paper, and connecting it to its purpose, until I could see all functions
   and their purposes before me. After that, the project became much more clear. This challenge also coincided with my struggles dealing with the game logic. I understood
   the first two functions, consisting of starting and ending the game. However, dealing with the progression system of the game was quite a challenge, as I
   do not have a lot of experience with game development. To deal with this challenge, I yet again utilized a visual approach, drawing the steps out as a form of pseudocode.
   Then, I attempted to translate that pseudocode into real code, and needless to say I almost reached an answer. I also utilized the material given by codepath
   for the game logic, and found it really helpful in guiding me to set it up.

3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
    What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words)
   One question I still hold about web development after completing my submission is how do the separate html, js, and css files work together to create the website itself?
   Usually I have been dealing with one file coding, but this assignment opened my eyes to multiple codes. I wonder how these three files work in unison and function behind the
   website. I am curious because I wish to know how the computer and the web execute these codes to create the website. Another question I have is, is it possible to include
   multiple javascript code files, and how would one be able to apply that concept in the real world? I am interested in knowing this because the combined elements
   of CSS, HTML, and Javascript can create websites who's boundaries are endless!

4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words)
   If I had a few more hours to work on this project, I would definitely spend more time making the website more polished. For example, I would love to add multiple games of this type on different tabs on the
   website. Creating more than one game with a similar approach as this project did would definitely serve as a challenge, but more importantly as a good learning experience as well. Games like Simon Says,
   a reaction-time-based game, and others are just a few examples that I would like to include in this project. Additionally, I would also have loved to implement a system where the patterns
   are selected at random, where everytime the user presses start and stop again, the pattern would change. This would definitely be an interesting element to add to the project. Finally, I would
   have also liked to have tried to implement a system where it plays a sound from a Youtube Link. Although I'm sure this would have been outside of the guidelines, it would have been interesting to set up for my
   own curiosity and usage.
